### Projects

#### Project 1: Using Generative Topographic Mapping (GTM) to Risk Stratify Breast Cancer Patients Post-Treatment

### Description
This project, developed as part of my Master's thesis, focuses on using **Generative Topographic Mapping (GTM)** to stratify real-world breast cancer patients based on their clinical data after successful treatment. The goal of the project was to identify clusters of patients and assess their risk of negative post-treatment outcomes, such as recurrence.

The process involved:
- Using **GTM** to create patient clusters based on demographic and clinical data.
- Applying a **Random Forest** model to predict the likelihood of negative outcomes within each cluster.
- Developing a **mathematical model** to rank patients by risk, aiding in clinical decision-making and personalized monitoring.

### Technologies
- **Python**: For data preprocessing, modeling, and analysis.
- **SQL**: For pulling data from NHS Database
- **Generative Topographic Mapping (GTM)**: For clustering patients based on clinical data.
- **Random Forest**: For predicting adverse outcomes within identified clusters.

### Important Note
The code and data used in this project are not available in this repository due to privacy and confidentiality concerns, as the data is derived from **private NHS patient records**.


#### Project 2: Data Visualization 
- **Description:** Example of Cleaning, Investigating and Visualizing a new Dataset. 
- **Technologies:** Python, GGplot, plotly.
